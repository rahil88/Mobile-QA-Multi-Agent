app_package: md.obsidian

tests:
  - id: T1_create_vault
    name: Create and Enter Vault
    description: >
      Open Obsidian and create a new local vault named 'InternVault'.
      Use tap_text to tap buttons by their exact visible text.
      Steps: 1) Tap button with text 'Create a vault'. 
      2) Tap 'On this device' option (NOT 'Obsidian Sync').
      3) Clear the default vault name and type 'InternVault'.
      4) Tap 'Create' button to confirm.
      5) If a permission dialog appears, tap 'Allow' or similar.
    expected_result: >
      The app is inside the vault. Success indicators: seeing 'New tab - Obsidian',
      'Create new note', 'Untitled - Obsidian', or any note editing UI.
      The vault has been created and is accessible.
    should_pass: true

  - id: T2_create_note
    name: Create Note with Content
    description: >
      Create a new note titled 'Meeting Notes' and type the text 'Daily Standup' into the body.
    expected_result: >
      A note named 'Meeting Notes' exists and is open. The note body contains
      the text 'Daily Standup'. The note should be visible in the file list/sidebar.
    should_pass: true

  - id: T3_appearance_color_check
    name: Verify Appearance Icon Color (Expected Fail)
    description: >
      Starting from the note view, navigate to Settings and verify that the 'Appearance' 
      tab/section icon is the color Red.
      Steps: 1) Tap the file menu button in the top left corner to open the sidebar. It is an hamburger icon.
      2) Tap the Settings gear icon on the right side of the 'InternVault' text in the sidebar.
      3) Once in Settings, tap on 'Appearance' in the settings list.
      4) STOP NAVIGATING! Now examine the screenshot - look at the right side of the text 'Accent color'.
         If the color is NOT red (gray, monochrome, or any other color), set is_complete=true 
         and report that the test FAILED because the color is not red.
    expected_result: >
      The color of the right side of the text 'Accent color' should be RED. If it is NOT red, the test FAILS.
    should_pass: false
    # Note: The icon is actually monochrome/default theme color, NOT red.
    # The agent should detect this mismatch and report a failure.

  - id: T4_print_to_pdf
    name: Verify Print to PDF Button is Missing
    description: >
      Search for 'Print to PDF' in the More options menu to confirm it doesn't exist.
      Steps: 1) Tap the 'More options' menu (three dots) to open the file menu.
      2) Scroll down 3 times to search through all menu options for 'Print to PDF'.
      3) If 'Print to PDF' is found, tap it - the test FAILS.
      4) If 'Print to PDF' is NOT found after scrolling, set is_complete=true - goal achieved!
    expected_result: >
